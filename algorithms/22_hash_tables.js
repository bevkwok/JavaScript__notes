// What is a hash table?
// It is used to store key-value pairs
// Key are not in ordered, not like arrays
// very fast to find, insert, delete

// Why do we need to learn this?
// basically all programming language has hash table like data structure
// It's a fast way to get data so it's commonly used

// Write our own hash table
// using an array
// need to convert keys into valid array indices
// the functions that perform this task is called a hash function

// When do we use it?
// When we don't care for the order
