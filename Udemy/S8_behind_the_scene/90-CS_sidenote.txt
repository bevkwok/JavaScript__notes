Compilation VS Interpretation

Conpilation:
convert all code into machine code at once
written to binary file to be executed by computer

Interpretation:
Interpreter runs through the source code
executes it line by line
very slow so JS is not using it

Just-in-time(JIT) compilation:
convert all code into machine code at once
then executed immediately
