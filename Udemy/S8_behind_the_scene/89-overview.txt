Low level programming language:

Garbage-collection algorithm

The computer only understand 0 and 1
How does it understand JS?
the process of converting JS to machine code is called compiling. This process happen inside JS engine.

-Multi-paradigm
Paradigm: An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique.
1. Procedural programming
2. Object-oriented programming(OOP)
4. Functional programming(FP)

-Prototype-based object-oriented
Prototype: similar to template
like when we make an array, the array inherits methods from the prototype

-First-calss functions
Functions are treated as variables
Passing functions into other functions

-Dynamically-typed
No data type definitions
Types becomes known at runtime

-Single-threaded
JavaScript can only do one thing at a time
Concurrency model: The way JS engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.

-Non-blocking event loop
by using a event loop

-Event loop
takes long running tasks, executes them in the 'background', put back in main thread once they are finished
