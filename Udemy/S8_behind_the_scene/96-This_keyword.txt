This keyword:
- it's a special variable that is created for every execution context (every function). It points to the "owner" of the function.
- "this" is not static, changes depends the way you call the function. It's value will be assigned when the function is called

In Method => this = the object where the method belongs
this = points to the global object
this (strict mode) = undefined
In Arrow function => this = the parent function
** Arrow function doesn't have it's own "this" **
In Event listener => this = the DOM element with the listener

** "this" never points to the function itself **
