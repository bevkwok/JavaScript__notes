What is Hoisting?
It makes some types of variables usable before they are actually declared
(this is not true) * Variables lifted to the top of their scope 

Hoisting (behind the scenes)
Code is scanned for variable declaration before execution. 
For each variable, a new property is created in the variable environment object.

What is Hoisted?
Function declaration (block scope) (actual function)
Var variable (function scope) (undefined)

*Not hoisted
let and const (uninitialized, TDZ) (Block)

*depends
Function expressions and arrows (depends if using var or let/const)

What is TDZ?
Temporal Dead Zone
Why use TDZ?
Easier to avoid and catch errors
Make const variable work correctly (can't start with undefined)

Hoisting has a lot of problem, why still do it?
More readable
Var variable is a byproduct of hoisting
