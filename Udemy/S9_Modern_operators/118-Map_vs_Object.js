////////// Data Structures Overview

//// Sources of Data
// From the program itself
// From the UI (user input)
// From external sources (APIs = application programming interface)
// => Collection of data
// => Need Data Structure to store

//// Want Simple List? Arrays / Sets
//// Want Key/Value Pares? Objects / Maps

////// JSON = very similar to JS objects

//// Other JS data structure - WeakMap, WeakSet

////////// Arrays VS. Sets
// Array is ordered and contain duplicates. Easier to manipulate data
// Set works with unique values, higher-performenace, can remove duplicates


////////// Objects VS. Maps
// Object is easier to write and access values, store methonds and JSON
// Map has better performance, any data type keys, easier to iterate
